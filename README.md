🤖🚦 AGENTIC PREDICTIVE INTELLIGENCE
🧠 HYBRID AI MACHINE LEARNING INFERENCE PLATFORM
(Python • Scikit-Learn • Pickle • Agent Logic)
🚀 TURNING TRAINED ML MODELS INTO INTELLIGENT AGENT-DRIVEN PREDICTIONS
🚀 WHAT IS AGENTIC PREDICTIVE INTELLIGENCE?
Agentic Predictive Intelligence is a Hybrid AI System that combines classical Machine Learning regression models with intelligent agent orchestration to perform real-time predictions.
Built to demonstrate modern Applied Machine Learning + Agentic AI Architecture for:
🤖 Intelligent Agents
📊 Predictive Analytics
🧠 Applied Machine Learning
⚡ Automated Inference Systems
🧠 CORE IDEA
Traditional ML models sit idle after training.
Agentic Predictive Intelligence brings them to life by wrapping them inside an intelligent agent pipeline:
➡️ User Input
➡️ Python Agent
➡️ Serialized ML Model (.pkl)
➡️ Prediction Engine
➡️ Intelligent Output
RESULT:
⚡ SMART ML INFERENCE
